## Design Decisions

Document all the design decisions made, along with the reasons for making those decisions.

### Decision 1

- **Date:** 1/13/2024
- **Decision:** App name: "Neighbors"
- **Reason:**
 “Neighbors” is a solid choice several reasons. 

1. It’s friendly and inviting while communicating 
what it’s trying to replicate digitally. 
2. It  communicates wholesome culture from the start.
This is critical. People aren't users in a database, but groups of neighbors in a community. 
3. Can be broken down further into intuitive logical groupings.

    Neighbor = User
    Group of neighbors = Neighborhood
    Group of neighborhoods = Community (equivalent would be categories on other platforms.)
